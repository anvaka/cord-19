## local development

1. Download [the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).
2. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

And then perform one-time initialization

```
git clone https://github.com/anvaka/cord-19
cd cord-19
npm install
```

Once all modules are installed, run the command to collect stats:

``` 
node print-stats.js path_to_kaggle_data_set
```

Here `path_to_kaggle_data_set` is the root folder with `json_schema.txt`
file in it. E.g.:

```
node print-stats.js ~/Downloads/2020-03-13
```
